Here are some prototype MATLAB codes for this project. 
We have kept them here in case they are useful, but note that the side views are modeled using BÃ©zier curves with predefined tangent directions rather than bi-arcs. For the correct implementation (which matches the method described in the paper), please refer to the web demo.
